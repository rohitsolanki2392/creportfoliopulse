Such adjustment shall be completed by multiplying the Base Monthly Rent by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the most recently published monthly Index preceding the first day of the upcoming lease year for which such annual adjustment is to be made, and the denominator of which fraction shall be the corresponding monthly Index immediately preceding the Commencement Date.
            
                 If the Index shall be discontinued with no successor or comparable successor Index, then Landlord shall have the right to substitute another similar index.
                  
           (d) In addition to the Base Annual Rent, Tenant shall also pay any other sums of money as they become due under the terms of this Lease (hereinafter referred to as "Additional Rent").

The Security Deposit shall not be mortgaged, assigned, transferred to, or encumbered by Tenant without the written consent of Landlord, and any such act on the part of the Tenant shall be without force and effect and shall not be binding upon Landlord.
 
           (b) If any Rent or other charges required by this Lease shall become overdue and unpaid or if Landlord makes any payments on behalf of Tenant, or if Tenant fails to perform any of the terms and covenants of this Lease, Landlord may, at its option, and without prejudice to any other remedy Landlord may have on account thereof, appropriate and apply the Security Deposit or so much thereof, as may be necessary to compensate Landlord for the payment of the Rent or other sums due from Tenant, or for any loss, damage, or expense sustained by Landlord resulting from such default on the part of Tenant; and in such event Tenant shall immediately without demand restore the Security Deposit to the original sum.

           (c) If any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other creditor-debtor proceedings are instituted by or against Tenant, the Security Deposit shall be deemed to apply first to the payment of any Rent or other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the institution of such proceedings and the balance, if any, of the Security Deposit may be retained by Landlord in partial liquidation of Landlord's damages.
 
           (d) No holder of a mortgage or deed of trust to which this Lease is subject or subordinate shall be responsible in connection with the Security Deposit, unless such mortgagee or deed of trust holder actually receives the Security Deposit.
 
           (e) If Landlord transfers its interest in the Premises, Landlord shall have the right to transfer the Security Deposit to the transferee thereof. In such event, upon the delivery by Landlord to Tenant of the transferee's written acknowledgment of its receipt of the Security Deposit, Landlord shall be deemed released by Tenant from all liability or obligation for the return of the Security Deposit, and Tenant agrees to look solely to such transferee for the return of the Security Deposit.
 
           (f) If Tenant is in default under this Lease more than two (2) times within any twelve (12) month period, irrespective of whether or not such default is cured, then, without limiting Landlord's other rights and remedies provided for in this Lease or at law or equity, the Security Deposit shall automatically be increased by an amount equal to the greater of:  (a) two (2) times the original Security Deposit, or (b) two (2) months' Rent, which shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord immediately upon demand.

Real Estate Taxes shall also include expenses of tax abatement or other proceedings contesting assessments or levies.
                 (ii) All expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with the operation, management, maintenance, and repairs or replacements in the Center, including but not limited to electricity (except as directly billed to tenants of the Center); utilities and utility taxes; water and sewer charges; all costs, charges and expenses incurred by Landlord in connection with any change in provider(s) of any utility (including, without limitation, maintenance, repair, installation and service costs associated therewith); insurance; repair or replacement, maintenance and cleaning of the Center and grounds, and supplies necessary therefor; uniforms and dry cleaning; cleaning of windows; snow removal; cleaning service and management contracts with independent contractors; general overhead and administrative expenses; management fees; benefits (including group life insurance), pension payments, payroll taxes, wages, license fees, and workmen's compensation insurance for employees, including, without limitation, property managers of Landlord engaged in the operation, maintenance, or repair of the Center.

           (c) The term "Comparison Year" shall mean each calendar year during the Term following the Base Year.  Landlord reserves the right from time to time to change the Comparison Year for calculating Operating Expenses so long as such change does not have a material adverse effect on Tenant.
           (d) Payments shall be made as follows:
                 (1) Prior to or during each Comparison Year, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with Landlord's estimate of the Operating Expenses (hereinafter referred to as "Estimated Operating Expenses") for such Comparison Year. On the first day of each month during such Comparison Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, one-twelfth (1/12th) of Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the amount, if any, by which Estimated Operating Expenses exceeds Operating Expenses for the Base Year.  From time to time, Landlord may revise Estimated Operating Expenses in which event Tenant's monthly payment shall be adjusted accordingly.
                 (2) Following the end of each Comparison Year, Landlord shall prepare and deliver to Tenant a statement of the amount of Tenant's Pro Rata Share of the increase, if any, in the actual Operating Expenses for such Comparison Year, or fraction thereof, over the Base Year, and such amount shall be considered Additional Rent.  For the purposes of this Section 8, Tenant's pro rata share ("Pro Rata Share") shall be ______% (i.e., the ratio between _______ (square feet of rentable area in Premises) and _______ (square feet of rentable area in Center)).
                 (3) If Tenant's Pro Rata Share of actual increases in Operating Expenses is greater than the amount of the Estimated Operating Expenses paid by Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the deficiency within thirty (30) days after delivery of said statement. If Tenant's Pro Rata Share of actual increases in Operating Expenses is less than the amount of the Estimated Operating Expenses paid by Tenant to Landlord, then so long as Tenant is not in default under this Lease, Landlord shall credit the excess against future monthly installments of Estimated Operating Expenses; provided, however, that for the calendar year during which the Term ends, Landlord shall refund any such excess to Tenant.  For any Comparison Year that falls only partially within the Term, Tenant's obligation for increases in Operating Costs for such Comparison Year shall be prorated based upon the ratio of (a) the number of days within such Comparison Year falling within the Term to (b) 365; provided that in computing the amount payable for the period between the commencement of the final Comparison Year and the Expiration Date, increases in Operating Costs shall be calculated by comparing the Operating Expenses for the Base Year to the actual Operating Expenses for the immediately preceding full Comparison Year, and any required payment shall be made by Tenant on or before the Expiration Date.  Tenant's obligation to pay its Pro Rata Share of Operating Expenses and Landlord's obligation to reimburse Tenant for any excess of Estimated Operating Expenses over actual increases in Operating Expenses reflected on any such statement shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.
 
           (e) If Tenant delivers a written request, Landlord shall promptly provide Tenant with a written summary of the Operating Expenses incurred for the Base Year and the Comparison Year with respect to any statement Tenant has received from Landlord.
 
           (f) Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall be construed at any time to reduce the Rent payable hereunder or serve as a credit against the Base Monthly Rent, assessments, or any other charges due from Tenant to Landlord under the terms of this Lease.
 
           (g) Operating Expenses for each calendar year shall be those actually incurred, provided, however, that if the Center was not at least one hundred percent (100%) occupied during the entire calendar year, or if any occupant is paying separately for electricity or janitorial services furnished to its premises, the Operating Expenses shall be adjusted to project the Operating Expenses as if the Center were one hundred percent (100%) occupied and as if electricity and janitorial services furnished to such premises were included in Operating Expenses.

           (b) To display a "For Lease" sign at any time, after notice from either party of intention to terminate this Lease, or at any time within twelve (12) months prior to the Expiration Date.  Prospective tenants authorized by Landlord may inspect the Premises at reasonable hours within this time period.
 
14. DAMAGE TO PREMISES
If the Premises is damaged by fire, casualty or other event insured against by Landlord's property insurance policy covering the Center, and the Premises can be fully repaired, in Landlord's opinion, within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the insured fire, casualty or other event, Landlord, at Landlord's expense, shall repair such damage, provided, however, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair any damage to, or to replace, Tenant's non-building standard tenant improvements or any fixtures, equipment or personal property of Tenant located in the Premises or other property Tenant is required to insure under this Lease.  Except as otherwise provided herein, if the entire Premises is rendered untenantable by reason of the insured fire, casualty or other event, then Base Monthly Rent shall abate for the period from the date of such damage or casualty to the date when Landlord has substantially completed repairs to the Premises as specified above, and if only a portion of the Premises is so rendered untenantable, then Base Monthly Rent shall abate for such period in the proportion which the area of the Premises so rendered untenantable bears to the total area of the Premises, provided, however, if, prior to the date when such repairs have been completed, any portion of the Premises so damaged shall be rendered tenantable and shall be used or occupied by Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant, then the amount by which the Base Monthly Rent shall abate shall be equitably apportioned for the period from the date of any such use or occupancy to the date when such repairs are completed.  No compensation or claim or reduction of rent will be allowed or paid by Landlord by reason of inconvenience, annoyance, injury or interruption to business or loss of profit arising from the necessity of repairing the Premises or any portion of the Center of which they are a part, however the necessity occurs, except as provided herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to or during the Term, (A) the Premises is so damaged that, in Landlord's sole opinion, the Premises cannot be fully repaired within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the damage occurred, or (B) the Center is so damaged by fire or other casualty insured against by Landlord's property insurance policy that, in Landlord's sole opinion, substantial repair or reconstruction of the Center shall be required (whether or not the Premises is damaged or rendered untenantable), then, in any of such events, Landlord, at its option, may give to Tenant, within sixty (60) days after such fire or other casualty, a thirty (30) days notice of termination of this Lease and, in the event such notice is given, this Lease shall terminate (whether or not the Term shall have commenced) upon the expiration of such thirty (30) days with the same effect as if the date of expiration of such thirty (30) days were the Expiration Date, and the then-applicable Base Monthly Rent shall be apportioned as of such date, including any rent abatement as provided above.
 
15. INDEMNIFICATION AND PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE
Tenant shall indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against any liabilities, obligations, damages, judgments, penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable architects' and attorneys' fees, as a consequence of the death or personal injury of any person, or damage to property, which death, personal injury, or damage to property occurs or is sustained as the result of any act, negligence, omissions or default of Tenant, its patrons, agents, employees, subtenants, licensees, contractors or invitees, in or in connection with the use of the Premises, or which may be attributable thereto or to the presence of any property of Tenant located upon the Premises.
Tenant shall at all times during the term hereof keep in force at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance and property damage insurance (ISO Causes of Loss-Special Form Coverage (formerly known as "all-risk")) provided by companies acceptable to Landlord, naming as additional insureds Landlord, Landlord's managing agent, any mortgagee or other lender with respect to the Center or any portion thereof, and any other designee(s) of Landlord (and containing provisions requiring thirty (30) days advance notice to Landlord of any cancellation or modification thereof), having the following minimum coverages:  (a) with respect to the liability insurance policy, Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) combined single limit for bodily injury or death arising out of the use of the Premises, and/or damage to property; and (b) with respect to the property damage insurance policy, the full replacement value of Tenant's leasehold improvements and personal property from time-to-time in, on or upon the Premises.  Such liability insurance policy shall be written on a commercial general liability form including, but not limited to personal injury liability, property damage liability, contractual liability and products liability. Tenant further agrees to carry plate glass insurance for the Premises, where applicable, and to furnish Landlord with evidence thereof.
Tenant shall further deposit the policy or policies of such insurance or certificates thereof with Landlord prior to occupancy of the Premises and at least forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of any insurance policy.  Landlord shall not be obligated to tender possession of the Premises to Tenant until Tenant provides Landlord with satisfactory evidence that Tenant has obtained and is maintaining the insurance required by this Lease.   All insurance carriers providing insurance required by this Section 15 must be licensed in the state in which the Premises is located and must have no less than an A.M. Best's A-/X rating.
 
16. WAIVER OF CLAIMS
           (a) Landlord and Landlord's agents, employees, and contractors shall not be liable for, and Tenant hereby releases Landlord from all claims for death, injury or damage to person or damage to property sustained by Tenant or any person claiming through Tenant resulting from any fire, accident, occurrence or condition in or about the Premises or the Center (other than bodily injury or death caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord) including but not limited to such claims for damage resulting from (i) any defect in or failure of plumbing, hydraulic, heating or air-conditioning equipment, or other electrical equipment, electric wiring or installation thereof, water pipes, stairs, railings, walks or elevators; (ii) any equipment or appurtenances becoming out of repair; (iii) the bursting, leaking or running of any tank, wash stand, water closet, waste pipe, drain or any other pipe or tank in, upon or about the Premises; (iv) the escape of steam or hot water; (v) the water, snow or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, or any other place upon or near the Premises or Center or otherwise; (vi) the falling of any fixture, tile, plaster or skylight; (vii) broken glass; and/or (viii) any act or omission of other tenants or occupants of the Center or of adjoining or contiguous property or buildings.
 
           (b) All personal property, fixtures and equipment of the Tenant in the Premises or in the Center shall be at the sole risk of the Tenant.  Tenant covenants to save the Landlord, its agents, employees and contractors harmless and indemnified from any loss, cost, expense, or liability incurred or claimed by reason of Tenant's negligence or use of the Premises.
 
           (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Tenant hereby waives and releases any and all rights of recovery, whether arising in contract or tort, against the Landlord (and Landlord's owners, and its and their respective partners, officers, shareholders, members, trustees, principals, agents, property managers, employees, directors, affiliates, managers, successors, and any mortgagee(s)) arising during the Term for any and all loss or damage to any property located within or constituting a part of the Center (inclusive of the Premises), which loss or damage arises from the perils that could be insured against under the ISO Causes of Loss-Special Form Coverage (formerly known as "all-risk"), including any deductible thereunder (whether or not the party suffering the loss or damage actually carries such insurance, recovers under such insurance or self insures the loss or damage) or which right of recovery arises from any loss or damage that could be insured under time element insurance, including, without limitation, loss of earnings or rents resulting from loss or damage caused by such a peril.  This waiver is in addition to any other waiver or release contained in this Lease.  If there is a conflict between this Section 16(c) and any other provision of this Lease, this paragraph shall control.  Tenant shall cause its property insurance policy insuring the Premises or the contents thereof, to provide that the insurer waives all rights of recovery by way of subrogation or otherwise against Landlord and the Landlord parties listed above in connection with any loss or damage which is covered by such policy or that such policy shall otherwise permit, and shall not be voided by the releases provided for above.
 
17. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING 
      (a) Tenant agrees not to assign, mortgage, pledge, or encumber this Lease, in whole or in part, or to assign this Lease or sublet the whole or any part of the Premises, or permit the use of the whole or any part of the Premises by any licensee, subtenant, concessionaire or other occupant ("Transfer"), without first obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing terms herein, if Tenant requests the consent of Landlord to a Transfer, Landlord shall have the option to (i) terminate the Lease with respect to that portion of the Premises that Tenant desires to transfer, in lieu of giving its consent or  (ii) recapture all or such portion of the Premises which Tenant proposes to transfer, at the lower of the current rent under the Lease or the rent Tenant proposes to obtain.  In connection with any request by Tenant for consent to a Transfer, Tenant shall submit to Landlord, in writing, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of the Transfer, a statement containing, but not limited to, the name of the proposed transferee, such information as to its financial responsibility and standing as Landlord may require, and all of the terms and provisions upon which the proposed Transfer is to be made, including a copy of the proposed assignment, sublease or other transfer document (although such copy need not have been executed, provided it contains the agreed-upon terms and provisions of the proposed Transfer), contract for sale of business, if applicable, and a floor plan delineating the area subject to the proposed Transfer.  Landlord may require that the proposed transferee complete Landlord's Lease Application and furnish such other documents as may be requested by Landlord.  In addition to any other provisions which Landlord may reasonably require, any Transfer (other than an assignment of this Lease) submitted to Landlord for approval shall contain the language set forth on Exhibit C.  Tenant agrees that, in the event of any such assignment, subletting, licensing, or granting of a concession, made with the prior written consent of Landlord, it and any Guarantor(s) (as defined in the Guaranty of Lease which is an addendum to this Lease) shall nevertheless remain primarily liable for the performance of all the terms, conditions and covenants of this Lease. The prohibition against assignment, subleasing or encumbrance of this Lease shall be construed to include a prohibition against any assignment, subleasing or encumbering of the Premises by operation of law or otherwise, including without limitation an assignment pursuant to the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any other insolvency laws or the transfer and/or issuance of fifty percent (50%) or more of the ownership voting interest of Tenant, if Tenant is not a publicly held corporation, to any persons or entities that are not owners of Tenant on the date of this Lease. Tenant will be required to pay a non-refundable assignment or subletting fee to Landlord in the amount of one month's rent or $2,500.00, whichever is greater. This fee is due and payable when the request for assignment or subletting is submitted to Landlord, and is considered to be Additional Rent.
 
      (b) Tenant shall reimburse to Landlord, as Additional Rent, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, which Landlord incurs by reason of or in connection with any assignment, sublease, or leasehold mortgage proposed or granted by Tenant (whether or not permitted under this Lease), and all negotiations and actions with respect thereto, such Additional Rent to be due and payable within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a statement of such costs and expenses from Landlord.
 
      (c) Upon Landlord's written consent to any such assignment or subletting, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent, within five (5) business days following the due dates of such sums, (a) fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which (i) the rent payable by any such assignee or sublessee of Tenant throughout the term exceeds (ii) the Base Monthly Rental otherwise payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease; plus (b) fifty percent (50%) of all other consideration payable for the assignment or sublease of this Lease, and (c) one hundred percent (100%) of assignee's or sublessee's security deposit. The foregoing is a freely negotiated arrangement between Landlord and Tenant respecting the allocation of appreciated rentals. This covenant shall survive the expiration of the Term of this Lease.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall have no right to transfer, assign, sublet, enter into license or concession agreements, or mortgage or hypothecate this Lease or Tenant's interest in the Premises or any part thereof to a foreign government or to any individual or entity whereby enforcement of the obligations of the Tenant under this Lease might be limited by sovereign immunity.  Any such attempted transfer, assignment, subletting, license or concession agreement, mortgage or hypothecation shall be void and confer no rights on such foreign government or individual or entity.
 
      (d) The consent by Landlord to any assignment or subletting to any party other than Landlord, including a subsidiary or affiliate, shall not be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant or any Guarantor(s) from the terms of any covenant or obligation under this Lease, and Tenant shall remain fully liable as a primary obligor for the payment of all rent and other charges payable by Tenant under this Lease and for the performance of all other obligations of Tenant under this Lease.  Landlord's collection or acceptance of rent from any assignee or subtenant of Tenant shall not constitute a waiver or release of Tenant of any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease, nor shall any such assignment or subletting be construed to relieve Tenant from giving Landlord said thirty (30) days notice or from obtaining the consent in writing of Landlord to any further assignment or subletting.  If Tenant is in default of any term, covenant or provision of this Lease, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord the rent due from any subtenant of Tenant and hereby authorizes and directs each such subtenant, upon notice from Landlord, to pay said rent directly to Landlord, the collection or acceptance of rent from any subtenant in such instance not to constitute a waiver or release of Tenant of any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease.  If an assignment or sublease is effected in violation of the terms of this Lease, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant, but no such assignment or collection shall be deemed a waiver of this covenant, acceptance of any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant, or a release of Tenant hereunder.
 
(e) No assignment or sublease shall release or discharge, in whole or in part, Tenant's liability (as a principal and not as a guarantor) for the full performance of the agreements, terms, covenants and conditions contained in this Lease.
(f) If Tenant defaults beyond the applicable notice and cure period, if any, set forth in Sections 20 and 25 herein, Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord the rent due from any subtenant or assignee of Tenant and hereby authorizes each such subtenant or assignee to pay said rent directly to Landlord.  The consent by Landlord to any assignment, transfer, or subletting to any party shall not be construed as a waiver or release of Tenant or Guarantor(s) under the terms of any covenant or obligation under this Lease, nor shall the collection or acceptance of rent from any such assignee, transferee, subtenant or occupant constitute a waiver or release of Tenant or Guarantor(s) of any covenant or obligation contained in this Lease.  In addition to the assignment or subletting fee due to Landlord from Tenant set forth above, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any costs and expenses, including legal fees, incurred in connection with any proposed or purported assignment, transfer or sublease.
(g) Wherever notice, demand, request, or any other communication of any nature is required to be given by Landlord or by any mortgagee to Tenant, no such notice, demand, request, or communication shall, in any event, be required to be given to any such assignee or sublessee, and any notice, demand, request or communication shall be given only to Tenant herein.
(h) Any assignment or subletting permitted hereunder shall be for the initial Term only, and shall not include any option or renewal rights.
(i) The form of agreement subleasing any portion of the Premises or assigning Tenant's interest in this Lease shall be subject to Landlord's prior written approval (and, in any event, any assignment agreement shall provide that the assignee shall assume the obligations of Tenant under this Lease).
           (j) In no event shall Tenant sublease any portion of the Premises or assign its interest in this Lease or otherwise permit occupancy of any portion of the Premises to (i) a current tenant of the Center; (ii) a prospective tenant of the Center; (iii) a governmental entity or a person or entity enjoying sovereign or diplomatic immunity; or (iv) a use which, in Landlord's sole opinion, may attract an undesirable volume, frequency or type of visitor or employee to the Center.
            
18. SUBORDINATION; ATTORNMENT
This Lease is subject and subordinate to any financing secured by deeds of trust or mortgages, assignments of rents and leases, financing statements, or other security agreements secured upon the Center or the Premises, duly recorded among the land records of the jurisdiction where the Premises is located. Tenant hereby attorns to any such lender or secured party, such attornment to be effective upon such lender's or secured party's acquisition of the Premises or the Center, provided that such lender shall not be liable for any defaults of Landlord prior to the date of such acquisition, nor be obligated to recognize any payment of Rent more than one (1) month in advance, nor be liable for the Security Deposit unless actually received by such lender. Tenant agrees to execute, within ten (10) days after demand, any instrument further evidencing this attornment and subordination to any bona fide financing, upon such instrument being presented to Tenant by Landlord, and Tenant hereby irrevocably appoints Landlord as attorney-in-fact for Tenant to execute such instrument and deliver the same in the name of Tenant.
If the Center, the Premises or any part respectively thereof is at any time subject to a mortgage or a deed of trust or other similar instrument, and this Lease or the rents are assigned to such mortgagee, trustee or beneficiary, and Tenant is given written notice thereof, including the post office address of such assignee, then Tenant may not terminate this Lease for any default on the part of Landlord without first giving written notice by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to such assignee at the address set forth in such notice.  The notice shall specify the default in reasonable detail, and afford such assignee a reasonable opportunity to make performance, at its election, for and on behalf of Landlord.
 
19. FINANCING AGREEMENTS
Landlord shall have a lien and security interest upon all the personal property of Tenant moved into the Premises, as and for security for the Rent and other obligations of Tenant herein provided.  Upon the written request of Landlord, Tenant shall execute any financing statements or other documents reasonably requested by Landlord to perfect its security interest.  In order to perfect and enforce said lien, Landlord may, at any time after default by Tenant in the payment of Rent or default of other obligations to be performed or complied with by Tenant under this Lease, seize and take possession of any and all personal property belonging to Tenant which may be found in and upon the Premises, and Landlord shall have all remedies available to a secured party under the laws of the state in which the Premises is located.  If Tenant fails to redeem the personal property so seized, by payment of whatever sum may be due Landlord under and by virtue of the provisions of this Lease, then and in that event, Landlord shall have the right, after twenty (20) days written notice to Tenant of its intention to do so, to sell such personal property so seized at public or private sale and upon such terms and conditions as to Landlord may appear advantageous, and after the payment of all proper charges incident to such sale, apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of any balance due to Landlord on account of Rent or other obligations of Tenant pursuant to this Lease.  If there shall then remain in the hands of Landlord any balance realized from the sale of said personal property as aforesaid, the same shall be paid over to Tenant.  The exercise of the foregoing remedy by Landlord shall not relieve or discharge Tenant from any deficiency owed to Landlord which Landlord has the right to enforce pursuant to any other provision of this Lease.
Tenant agrees not to enter into, execute, or deliver any financing agreement or security agreement that can be considered as a priority to Landlord's deed of trust or mortgage financing.  If Tenant does so execute or deliver such financing agreement or security agreement, such action on the part of Tenant shall be considered a default under this Lease entitling Landlord to such remedies as are provided for herein.
 
20. PERFORMANCE OF TENANT'S COVENANTS
Tenant covenants and agrees that it will perform all covenants, conditions, and agreements herein expressed on its part to be performed, and that it will promptly upon receipt of written notice of non-performance thereof, comply with the requirements of such notice; and further, that if Tenant shall not comply with such notice to the satisfaction of Landlord within five (5) days after delivery thereof (or, if such compliance cannot reasonably be completed within five (5) days, if Tenant shall not commence to comply immediately upon delivery of notice and thereafter proceed to completion with due diligence), Tenant shall be in default, and Landlord may, at its option do or cause to be done anything required to effect such compliance, and in so doing, Landlord shall have the right to cause its agents, employees and contractors to enter upon the Premises, and Tenant agrees to pay upon demand, any monies paid or expenses incurred by Landlord in taking such action, any such sum to be collectable from Tenant as Additional Rent hereunder.
 
21. WAIVER; CUSTOM AND USAGE
           (a) Receipt by Landlord of rent with knowledge of the breach by Tenant of any covenant contained herein shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach. No payment by Tenant of a lesser amount than the Base Monthly Rent, as adjusted, shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest unpaid Rent, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any writing accompanying such check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover any remaining balance due. No waiver by Landlord of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed to have been made, unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord. In addition to the other remedies provided in this Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall be entitled to the restraint by injunction of the violation or attempted or threatened violation of any of the covenants, conditions, or provisions of this Lease.
 
           (b) It is hereby covenanted and agreed, any law, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding, that Landlord shall have the right at all times to enforce the covenants, conditions, and agreements of this Lease in strict accordance with the terms hereof, notwithstanding any conduct or custom on the part of Landlord in doing or in refraining from so doing at any time or times; and further, that the failure of Landlord at any time or times to enforce its rights under this Lease strictly in accordance with the same shall not be construed as having created a custom in any way or manner contrary to the specific terms, provisions and covenants of this Lease or as having in any way or manner modified or waived the same.
 
22. SURRENDER AND HOLDING OVER
Without notice, Tenant, upon expiration or termination of this Lease, either by lapse of time or otherwise, agrees peaceably to remove its movable personal property and trade fixtures and to surrender to Landlord the Premises in broom clean and in the same condition as on the Commencement Date, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.  If Tenant fails to immediately surrender the Premises on the Expiration Date or earlier termination of this Lease, Landlord, in addition to all other remedies available to it hereunder, shall have the right to receive, as liquidated damages for all the time Tenant shall so retain possession of the Premises or any part thereof, an amount equal to twice the Base Monthly Rent, as adjusted, and Additional Rent, if any, as applied to such period. If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises with Landlord's consent but without a new lease reduced to writing and duly executed, Tenant shall be deemed to be occupying the Premises as a tenant from month to month, which month-to-month tenancy may be terminated by Landlord or Tenant upon thirty (30) days written notice, subject to all of the covenants, conditions and agreements of this Lease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 22, if Tenant holds over after the Expiration Date or earlier termination of this Lease, and Landlord desires to regain possession of the Premises, then Landlord, at its option, may forthwith re-enter and take possession of the Premises without legal proceeding, or by any legal process in force in the jurisdiction in which the Center is located.  Any rental amounts for such holdover period which are deposited into Landlord's rental account shall not be deemed accepted by Landlord if Landlord promptly returns such rental amounts to Tenant, or, if permitted by law, if Landlord deposits the same in an escrow account.  Nothing herein shall limit Landlord's right to recover damages pursuant to this Lease and such other damages as are available to Landlord at law or in equity (including but not limited to any and all damage caused by such holdover).
 
23. CONDEMNATION
Except as specifically permitted in this Section 23, Tenant hereby waives the right to receive any portion of any condemnation award resulting from the exercise of the power of eminent domain of any governmental body, whether such loss or damage results from condemnation of a part or all of the Center or the Premises. Should any power of eminent domain be exercised after Tenant is in possession, such exercise shall not void or impair this Lease unless the Premises shall be rendered untenantable in whole or in part, in which event the Rent shall proportionately abate.
If under eminent domain, all of the Premises is taken, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking.  If greater than fifty percent (50%) of the Premises are taken, either party may terminate this Lease upon notice to the other within sixty (60) days after title vests in the condemning authority.  If neither party elects to terminate this Lease, Rent shall be reduced by the percentage that the part taken bears to the entire Premises.  Landlord shall be entitled to all damages and compensation awarded for any taking.  Tenant, however, may claim any award made specifically for fixtures and other equipment installed by it, but only if such award shall be made by the condemnation court in addition to and stated separately from the award made by it for the land and the Center or part thereof so taken.  In no event shall Tenant claim any award for its leasehold estate.
 
24. NOTICES
Whenever in this Lease it shall be required or permitted that notice or demand be given or served by any party to this Lease to or on the other, such notice or demand shall be deemed to have been duly given or served if in writing and either personally delivered or as of the third (3rd) business day after mailing of such notice by United States mail by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or as of the immediately following business day after deposit for next day delivery with Federal Express or similar nationally recognized overnight service:

25. DEFAULT OF TENANT
Tenant agrees, and it is hereby made a condition of this Lease, that (i) if Tenant shall fail to pay Base Monthly Rent, as adjusted, Additional Rent, or other charges herein, at the time and place required herein; or (ii) if Tenant shall fail in the performance and/or observance of any of the other covenants, conditions, and agreements of this Lease, which failure shall continue for a period of five (5) days after Landlord gives Tenant written notice thereof; or (iii) if Tenant shall be adjudicated insolvent within the meaning of insolvency in equity proceedings, or if Tenant shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if a permanent receiver or trustee shall be appointed for Tenant or for Tenant's property, or if a temporary receiver or trustee of Tenant or Tenant's property shall be appointed and such permanent or temporary receiver or trustee shall not be discharged within thirty (30) days from the date of appointment, or if any other execution, levy, attachment, or other process of law be made, or attempted to be made upon Tenant's interest in the leasehold estate or any part thereof; or (iv) if this Lease or Tenant's estate or any of Tenant's interest herein shall (except as hereinbefore expressly permitted) be transferred or pass to or devolve, whether by operation of law or otherwise, upon any entity or person other than Tenant; or (v) if Tenant abandons the Premises or fails to conduct business therein for a period of fifteen (15) or more consecutive days, or if Tenant removes or attempts to remove or manifests an intention to remove, Tenant's goods or property out of the Premises otherwise than in the ordinary course of business and without having first paid Landlord for all Rent which may become due during the entire term of this Lease, then in any of such events, Landlord at Landlord's option, may at such times as Landlord may determine in Landlord's sole discretion, concurrently or successively, without being deemed to have waived any rights or to have made an election in any circumstance, do any or all of the following:
 
           (a) Terminate this Lease and the then unexpired term hereof, except as to the rights and remedies of Landlord upon termination as provided herein, in which event Tenant shall immediately quit and surrender the Premises, including any and all improvements thereon, without demand of Rent or demand of possession of the Premises, notice to quit or of intention to re-enter the same being expressly waived by Tenant and Landlord may then, immediately or at any time thereafter, without judicial proceedings of any kind, enter into and repossess the Premises, breaking open locked doors if necessary, and may use such force as it may deem necessary to effect such entrance and may remove all occupants thereof and any property thereon without being liable for any action or prosecution of any kind for such entry or the manner thereof or loss of or damage to any property in or upon the Premises.
Should the Lease be terminated as a result of Tenant's default, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as liquidated damages, for each month during the balance of the term (but for termination of the Lease), any deficiency between (a) all Rent herein reserved for each such month, and (b) the net rent for each such month collected upon any reletting. Alternatively, if this Lease is terminated as a result of Tenant's default, Landlord may elect; in addition to all other damages recoverable under this paragraph, to recover from Tenant the net present value at the time of said election, of the excess, if any, of all Rent due under this Lease for the remainder of the term (but for termination of the Lease) over the then reasonable rental value (as reasonably determined by Landlord) of the Premises for that period.  Such amount shall be discounted using a discount factor equal to the yield of the Treasury Note or Bill, as appropriate, having a maturity period approximately commensurate to the remainder of the Term, and such resulting amount shall be payable to Landlord in a lump sum on demand, it being understood that upon payment of such liquidated and agreed final damages, Landlord and Tenant shall be released from further liability under this Lease with respect to the period after the date of such payment.
 
           (b) Without terminating the Lease, and without notice, Landlord may, without judicial proceedings of any kind, enter into and repossess the Premises, breaking open locked doors if necessary, and may use such force as it deems necessary to effect such entrance and may remove all occupants thereof and any property thereon without being liable for any action or prosecution of any kind for such entry or the manner thereof or loss of or damage to any property upon the Premises.
In the event of either (a) or (b), Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to, obtain possession of the Premises by unlawful detainer or any other judicial proceeding which it may, in its sole discretion, institute for such purpose.  Landlord's obtaining of possession of the Premises, either with or without judicial proceedings for that purpose shall not, of itself, terminate this Lease.
 
           (c) With or without terminating this Lease and/or with or without re-entering and obtaining possession of the Premises, Landlord may lease the Premises to any other entity on terms which Landlord, in its sole discretion, deems advisable and for a term within or beyond the term of this Lease, and Tenant shall be liable for any damages incurred by Landlord as a result of Tenant's default, including but not limited to loss in Rent for the balance of the then-current term together with any expenses or costs incurred by Landlord in re-renting the Premises, including, but not limited to the payment of advertising, commissions and attorney's fees, the making of alterations or otherwise placing the Premises in first class rentable condition, and Landlord may recover such damage at any time, or from time to time, after any of the foregoing events, whether prior to the end of the term herein granted or otherwise.
It is further agreed that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by Tenant of any of the covenants, conditions, or agreements hereof, Landlord shall have the right of injunction to restrain the same and the right to invoke any remedy allowed by law or in equity, whether or not other remedies, indemnity or reimbursements are herein provided.  It is further agreed that the various rights and remedies, power, options, and elections of Landlord reserved, expressed, or contained in this Lease are distinct, separate, and cumulative and no one of them shall be deemed to be exclusive of the other rights, remedies, powers or options as are provided herein, or are now or may hereafter be conferred upon Landlord by statute or by state law.
No such termination of this Lease, nor taking, nor recovering possession of the Premises with or without termination of this Lease, shall deprive Landlord of any remedies or actions against Tenant for Rent and/or for damages due or to become due for the breach of any covenant, condition, or agreement herein contained, nor shall the bringing of any such action for Rent, or breach of any covenant, condition, or agreement, nor the resort to any other remedy herein or otherwise provided for the recovery of Rent and/or damage for such breach, be construed as a waiver of the right to insist upon the forfeiture of and to obtain possession of the premises in the manner herein provided.
Tenant agrees that if any Rent or Additional Rent shall remain unpaid on any day on which the same ought to be paid, then Landlord or any person acting under Landlord, or any officer of any court acting on behalf of Landlord, may enter the Premises and without further demand proceed by distress and/or sale of the goods there found to levy the rent and all other charges herein payable as rent, and all costs and officers' commissions, including watchmen's wages, shall be paid by Tenant, and that in such case, all costs, officers' commissions, and other charges shall immediately attach and become part of the claim of Landlord for rent, and any tender of rent without costs made after the issuance of a warrant of distress, shall not be sufficient to satisfy the claim of the Landlord. Tenant hereby expressly waives the benefit of all laws now made or that hereafter may be -made regarding any limitation of time within which distress may be levied after removal of goods from the Premises, and further relieves Landlord of any obligation of proving or identifying or appraising such goods, and Tenant hereby agrees not to lease goods of any kind for use on the Premises with the understanding that such goods shall be exempt from levy for rent, and other charges herein reserved as rent.
Tenant hereby expressly waives, for itself and all persons claiming by, through or under it, any right of redemption, re-entry or restoration of the operation of this Lease under any present or future Law, including without limitation any such right which Tenant would otherwise have in case Tenant shall be dispossessed for any cause, or in case Landlord shall obtain possession of the Premises as herein provided.
Tenant agrees to pay all Landlord's expenses incurred in collecting the Rent reserved herein, in enforcing the terms of this Lease, or in recovering possession of the Premises, or resolving any other dispute arising under this Lease, including, but not limited to attorney's fees and court costs.
The parties hereto shall and they hereby do waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either of the parties hereto against the other on any matters whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, and/or any claim of injury or damage.  Tenant shall not impose any counterclaim or counterclaims in any summary proceeding or other action based on termination or holdover, except to the extent that Tenant's failure to make such claim in such proceeding would, as a matter of law, preclude Tenant from raising such claim in any other proceeding or forum.
All rights and remedies of Landlord set forth in this Lease are cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, including those available as a result of any anticipatory breach of this Lease.  The exercise by Landlord of any such right or remedy shall not prevent the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy.  No delay or failure by Landlord to exercise or enforce any of Landlord's rights or remedies or Tenant's obligations shall constitute a waiver of any such rights, remedies or obligations.  Landlord shall not be deemed to have waived any default by Tenant unless such waiver expressly is set forth in a written instrument signed by Landlord.  If Landlord waives in writing any default by Tenant, such waiver shall not be construed as a waiver of any covenant, condition or agreement set forth in this Lease except as to the specific circumstances described in such written waiver.
      If Landlord shall commence any proceeding  for non-payment of Rent or any other payment of any kind to which Landlord may be entitled or which it may claim hereunder, Tenant will not interpose any counterclaim or setoff of whatever nature or description in any such proceeding unless Tenant's inability to do so would impair Tenant from pursuing a separate action or process on such claim, the parties hereto specifically agreeing that Tenant's covenants to pay Rent or any other payments required of it hereunder are independent of all other covenants and agreements herein contained. Tenant hereby waives the right to have any such separate action consolidated or joined with any such proceeding brought by Landlord pursuant to the first sentence of this Section.
26. SEVERABILITY; CONSTRUCTION
It is agreed that if any provision of this Lease shall be determined to be void by any court of competent jurisdiction, then such determination shall not affect any other provisions of this Lease, all of which other provisions shall remain in full force and effect; and it is the intention of the parties hereto that if any provision of this Lease is capable of two constructions, one of which would render the provision void and the other of which would render the provision valid, then the provision shall have the meaning which renders it valid.
 
27. QUIET ENJOYMENT
Landlord covenants that it has the right to make this Lease; and, that if Tenant shall pay the rental and perform all of the covenants, terms and conditions of this Lease to be performed by Tenant, Tenant shall, subject to the terms of this Lease, freely, peaceably, and quietly occupy and enjoy the full possession of the Premises, without molestation or hindrance by Landlord, its agents or employees.
 
28. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS

30. FORCE MAJEURE
If Landlord or Tenant shall be delayed, or hindered, or prevented from the performance of any act required hereunder, except the payment of Rent, by reason of governmental restrictions, weather, the elements, acts of God, strikes, scarcity of labor and materials, or for other reasons beyond their reasonable control, the performance of such act shall be excused for the period of delay, and the period for the performance of any such act shall be extended for a period equivalent to the period of such delay.  Delays or failures to perform resulting from lack of funds shall not be deemed delays beyond the reasonable control of a party.
It is expressly agreed that Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant, nor shall this Lease be impaired, by a temporary lack of any services to be provided hereunder by Landlord which is caused by strike, act of God, the elements, breakdown of machinery, or any other cause beyond the control of the Landlord, provided Landlord in good faith and with due diligence takes the necessary action to, and does, restore the services so interrupted.

Tenant's failure to deliver such estoppel certificate on a timely basis shall constitute a breach hereof, and Landlord shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies granted it hereunder or by law without having first to provide Tenant with any notice of default or a time period within which to cure such default.

EXHIBIT C
REQUIRED TRANSFER LANGUAGE
      Any Transfer (other than an assignment of the Lease) submitted to Landlord for approval shall contain the following clause (with defined terms appropriately modified if the Transfer is not a sublease):
      "Underlying Lease Agreement.  This Sublease and Subtenant's rights under this Sublease shall at all times be subject and subordinate to the underlying Lease identified in Paragraph ___ hereof, and Subtenant shall perform all obligations of Tenant under said Lease, and otherwise abide by all of the terms of said Lease, with respect to the Sublease Premises.  Subtenant acknowledges that any termination of the underlying Lease shall extinguish this Sublease, except as Landlord may otherwise elect as hereinafter provided.  Landlord's consent to this Sublease shall not make Landlord a party to this Sublease, shall not create any privity of contract between Landlord and Subtenant or other contractual liability or duty on the part of Landlord to the Subtenant, shall not constitute its consent or waiver of consent to any subsequent sublease or sub-sublease, and shall not in any manner increase, decrease or otherwise affect the rights and obligations of Landlord and Tenant under the underlying Lease, in respect of the Sublease Premises.  Any term of this Sublease that in any way conflicts with or alters the provisions of the underlying Lease shall be of no effect as to Landlord and Landlord shall not assume any obligations as landlord under the Sublease and Tenant shall not acquire any rights under the Sublease directly assertable against Landlord under the underlying lease.  Tenant hereby collaterally assigns to Landlord this Sublease and any and all payments due to Tenant from Subtenant as additional security for Tenant's performance of all of its covenants and obligations under the underlying lease, and authorizes Landlord to collect the same directly from Subtenant and otherwise administer the provisions of this Sublease; provided, however, that such assignment and authorization shall only be effective, at the option of Landlord, in the event of a default by Tenant under the underlying Lease.  Subtenant hereby consents to such collateral assignment of this Sublease to Landlord and agrees to observe its obligations created hereby.  Landlord's collection or acceptance of rent from Subtenant shall not constitute a waiver or release of Tenant of any covenant or obligation contained in the Lease.  If Landlord terminates the underlying Lease, and elects to preserve this Sublease as a lease between Landlord and Subtenant, as tenant, then Subtenant agrees to attorn to Landlord as landlord under the Sublease, except that Landlord shall not  (i) be liable for any previous act or omission of Tenant under the Sublease;  (ii) be subject to any off-set or other liability that Subtenant might have against Tenant for acts or occurrences prior to the date of Landlord's election to continue the Sublease as a lease with Subtenant; or  (iii) be bound by any modification of the Sublease not approved by Landlord, by any security deposit held by Tenant, by any payment due from Tenant to Subtenant, by any prepayment by Subtenant of rent more than one (1) month in advance, by any brokerage commission due to any party from Tenant, or by any default of Tenant."
